# Digital Book of Century - Charlotte Mason Method

A digital timeline tool for homeschooling families, implementing the Charlotte Mason Book of Centuries method for historical education.

## Overview

This project adapts the timeline concept from [life tracking](https://life.zainf.dev) to create an educational tool for children to visualize and connect historical events across 20 centuries (1-2000 AD).

## Features (Planned)

- **Century View**: 100-year timelines for focused historical study
- **Individual Books**: Separate timelines for each child
- **Decap CMS**: User-friendly content management
- **Printable Pages**: Generate physical Book of Centuries pages
- **World History Focus**: Wars, political events, rulers, discoveries

## Educational Philosophy

Based on Charlotte Mason's approach where children:
- Make personal connections with historical figures
- Discover chronological relationships naturally
- Build their own understanding through living books
- Create a lifelong learning artifact
